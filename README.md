# Heap-and-Priority-Queue
Heap and priority queue classes and a test program that implements them. Written in fall of 2019 as an academic project.

These programs were developed collaboratively with a fellow student as an academic project. show11.cpp, test11.cpp, and test11pq.cpp were provided by the instructor.

Description of files:
Heap.cpp and Heap.h implement the heap class.
PriorityQueue.cpp and PriorityQueue.h implement the priority queue class.
test11.cpp and test11pq.cpp enable users to interact with heap or priority queue instances.
show11.cpp visualizes the heap or priority queue the user is working with.
config.h controls whether heaps or priority queues are being worked with.
